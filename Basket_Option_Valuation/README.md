# Basket Call Option Valuation
## Consider a basket call option on two assets. For the first asset, 
### 
- the current asset price is $100,
- it doesn't pay dividend, 
- volatility is 50% per year.
## For the second asset,
### 
- the current asset price is $150,
- dividend yield is 3% per year,
- volatility is 40% per year.

## The risk free interest rate is 1% per year with continuous compounding. Assume the Black-Scholes-Merton model for both assets. The log returns of the two assets are correlated with coefficient 0.1. The strike price of the basket call is K=$250. The maturity of the option is 1 year.
